Fonts/Typography
We will be using Google Fonts for this aspect of the website
* Be consistent with the use of one particular font to keep the simplistic vibe:
   * We will be using Roboto Slab
      * Please go to Google Fonts for instructions on adding fonts. 


Links
Any links included will be bolded in one of our colours
* Once you hover over it, it will change to another colour. [This is used to ensure the user that the link is clickable. (from #24361d   to #3D0C11  )]


Buttons
We will use simple rectangles with curved edges or 3D-looking rectangles as buttons.
* Once the button is showcased, it will be in the colour hex #436436. 
   * When the user hovers over the button it will be in a slightly darker shade. Then once the button is pressed it will become a much darker shade. (Include color hex and be consistent)
